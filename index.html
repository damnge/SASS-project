          Selectors that are nested inside the scope of another selector are
          referred to as children. The former selector is referred to as
          the parent. This is just like the relationship observed in HTML
          elements. In SCSS, nesting is not limited only to selectors. You can
          also nest common CSS properties if you append a : colon suffix after
          the name of the property.

        <p>
          Variables in SCSS allow you to assign an identifier of your choice to
          a specific value. Why is that useful? Unlike in CSS, if you need to
          tweak a value, you’ll only have to update it in one place and the
          change will be reflected in multiple rules.
        </p>

          There are different data types you can assign to a variable in CSS. In
          addition to the color data type we have seen, there are also:
          <ul>
          <li>Numbers,such as 8.11, 12, and 10px.
            Notice that while 10 has a unit of px associated with it, it is still considered a number. </li>
          <li>Strings oftext, with and without quotes. Some examples
            are "potato", 'tomato', span.</li>
          <li>Booleans, or simply true and false. null, which is considered an
            empty value</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <a href="#my_section_4"><button class="btn">And You?</button></a>

        <h1>I Feel Amazing</h1>
        <p>
          The @forward rule loads a Sass stylesheet and makes its mixins, functions, and variables available when your stylesheet is loaded with the @use rule. It makes it possible to organize Sass libraries across many files, while allowing their users to load a single entrypoint file.
          <br/>
          The @use rule can be used to import other
          stylesheets as modules, the components of which can then be accessed
          in a modular fashion. The namespace for the module is just the last
          component of the path, but can be aliased using ‘as’.

    <section class="fifth__section" id="my_section_5">

        <h1>It Was Nice to Meet You</h1>
        <p>
          In addition to variables and nesting, Sass has multiple constructs
          that reduce repetition. In Sass, a mixin lets you make groups of CSS
          declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site.
          <br />
          <br />
          Mixins also have the ability to take in a value. An argument, or
          parameter, is a value passed to the mixin that will be used inside the
          mixin,
